This repository is the public repository for the Master Thesis on a "Security Assessment of the Sharekey Collaboration App". It contains code, proofs, and documents related to the Sharekey protocol review conducted as part of a master's thesis. The contents are organized as follows:

- The [Python client](client) folder contains code for a Python implementation of the Sharekey protocol, including tools for manual attacks and automated testing.
- The [Tamarin code](tamarin) folder contains formal verification models for the Sharekey protocol, written using the Tamarin Prover tool, along with the diagrams for the attacks found by tamarin
- The [Thesis PDF](Pascal-Schaerli_Security-Assessment-of-the-Sharekey-Collaboration-App.pdf) is the final report of the protocol review.
